# Guessing Game by Gren4586

This is a simple game I developed as a personal project to apply my learning of JavaScript.
The only goal is to click on the correct card, which is obscured until a card is clicked. If you picked the right one, you win a point, and if you picked the wrong one, that is also kept track of.
