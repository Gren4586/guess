# Guessing Game by Gren4586

## This is a game I developed as a personal project to apply my learning of JavaScript.

***

The goal of the game is to **click on the correct card,** which is obscured until a card is clicked. Picking the *right card* wins you a point, and picking the *wrong* one tallies a point under **"Rounds Lost."**

There is no end to the game, the player may simply *go until they become bored of the game.*
